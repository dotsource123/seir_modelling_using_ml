Epidemiological Modeling and Forecasting of COVID-19 Using SEIR and MLP Regressor

Applied SEIR compartmental model and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor to model and forecast Indiaâ€™s first COVID-19 wave.

Conducted data cleaning, preprocessing, and parameter optimization using real-world datasets (Johns Hopkins University, Our World In Data).

Implemented SEIR model using differential equations to simulate disease spread; validated using real-time data and visualized predictions against actual cases.

Trained MLP model using synthetic SEIR data for future case forecasting; evaluated performance using error metrics and visual analysis.

Tools: Python (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib), ODE solvers, optimization algorithms, machine learning techniques.
